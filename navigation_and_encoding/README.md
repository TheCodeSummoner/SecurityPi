## Navigation and Encoding

This series of tasks will help with building your knowledge of the Linux terminal and testing your knowledge of encoding/encrypting methods.

### General notes
Each challenge comprises of two parts. Finding the cipher text and deciphering the message.
Finding the cipher text will teach the user about system navigation and file handling within Linux.
Decoding the cipher text will test the userâ€™s knowledge of encoding and encryption.

In true CTF fashion hints are littered throughout the challenges. 
References are obvious and a quick google search can often aid in task completion.

The online [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) tool produced by GCHQ is a huge help when it comes to solving the encoding/encryption section of the tasks. Not all the tasks can be completed with this tool alone, pen and paper will help some of them!


### Emperor
This challenge forms the introduction to the challenges. It combines some basic terminal skills with some classical ciphers to ease users into the challenges.

### Ring Ring
This challenge has some additional complexity, requiring resources not contained within the CyberChef tool, as well as some creative interpretation of supplied information!

### Feel The Challenge
This task uses a commonly found but possibly seldom known format that may leave some users scratching their heads!

### Fibres
This task can be solved elegantly using a programmed solution. It can also be completed with pen and paper if the user wishes.

### Telegram
The final task requires greater knowledge of the terminal. The reward is worth it however!
